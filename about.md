## About Christopher Hart
I am an artist, living in Austin, TX. I was trained as a potter and have made a number of runs at free-standing entrepreneurial projects, though none have meaningfully clicked. I presevere, nonetheless. God is good and I believe these trials are simply preparing me for a success in the offing. Getting a handle on elemental web development and computer programming is going to be key to making the most of both my art and business undertakings.
