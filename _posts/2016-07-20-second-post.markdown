## This is my new post!
I love that I've gotten to the point of hosting a blog on GitHub. This is all very exciting.
I'm not natively a technical person, but I've been led to stretch myself and see what I can accomplish. I'm grateful to Jake Bapple (<a href="https://github.com/bapplejax" class="user-mention">@bapplejax</a>), Marysol Ortiz and staff at the Austin Coding Academy (<a href="https://github.com/AustinCodingAcademy" class="user-mention">@AustinCodingAcademy</a>) who took me through ACA's introductory course to learn HTML, CSS and the basics of GitHub. Now it's on me to see what I can do with that education and engage with this creative community.
