## This is my new post!
I love that I've gotten to the point of hosting a blog on GitHub. This is all very exciting.
I'm not natively a technical person, but I've been led to stretch myself and see what I can accomplish. I greatful to Jake Bapple, Marysol Ortiz and staff at the Austin Coding Academy (www.austincodingacademy.com) who took me through ACA's introductory course to learn HTML, CSS and the basics of GitHub. Now it's on me to see what I can do with that education and engage with this creative community.
