## What I Should Have Said 
Today I remembered something I hadn't done in a while. Clean the car? No. Not exactly.

The other day when I went to Wash 'n Roll, I saw two cars - each with a dog - parked next to each other. The animals weren't reciting poetry, silly. They were just waiting for their people to get done cleaning the car so they could go back about their travels.

I neglected to document this finding at the time. Please consider that oversight now corrected. #MambaOut
