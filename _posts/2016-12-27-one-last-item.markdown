## ...but now it's not
If there were some way to play checkers on this website, you have to know I'd do it. Checkers is rad.

I like the checkers board that has red and black squares. Some people like the boards with white and black squares, but I don't understand why. Those can be fine chess boards, but I don't think they rate as checkers boards.

I've never seen a checker's board with yellow and black squares. It's probably not that hard to make. I'd just take a white and black board and paint the white squares yellow.

I wish you would bring some beer next time.
