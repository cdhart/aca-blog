## Now I write
I'm gaining a modest amount of confidence in my ability to set my goals and hit my marks. I've still got some tricky issues, but my hope is that I can persevere and keep working out things on the fly.
I'm trying to externalize my process. It's messy and unclear to me exactly what to do at any given point. Here and now, I'm just trying to show up work on repetitions. Quantity is better than quality. Learn this new habit. Thank you.
