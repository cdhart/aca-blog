## Something Funny
I thought for a moment about titling this blog post "almost normal" but hesitated to alter my initial slug. I resist chainging first impressions. And at the end of the day, I don't put much stock in titles, anyway, so I don't think it really matters. As a young visual artist, I'd regularly anguish over the title for a piece. Ultimately, I devised an relatively impersonal and substantially meaningless system to name the artwork. That ended up working well enough for me, so I don't think I really need to sweat these blog post titles.
The real point of all this is to document that the work continues. It's still substantially undefined, but it's not without purpose. I'm reaching a new level of conviction that trusting my instincts will bear fruit. I wouldn't have ever doubted that in the past, but now I'm actually practicing it. This blog is what it is and I don't need to sweat it (or conprehend it) as long as it continues to be.
One bit to mention is a recent post from the noted creative Dave Winer, explaining <a=href "http://scripting.com/2015/02/07/theUneditedVoiceOfAPerson.html> his take on blogging </a>.
