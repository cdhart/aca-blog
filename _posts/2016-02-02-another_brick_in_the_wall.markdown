## Nothing's important*
I wonder about this sometimes, but at this moment I'm firmly in the predetermination camp. Free will is good and all, but the weight that places on one's choices seems too ornerous to abide by. Every choice would have to matter and that just seems too consequential to live with.
Here and now, at least, predetermination is immensely more freeing. I have to be free to create. I can't be weighed down by the what-ifs or what-may-bes. Maybe if I didn't function with such large amplitude in my activity. I'd love to live in a nice and tidy box, but that just not where I am. I'll make this choice and invest what resources I have in pressing into my faith and making the best choice possible with the information I have at my disposal at the time.

*except for the stuff that is important
