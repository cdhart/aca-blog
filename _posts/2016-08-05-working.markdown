## Working
I've spent my avialable energy in the intervening time from my last post to grind on the mechanincs of getting a work flow established with GitHub. I've gpten the files to www.cdhart.com established in a functioning repository that are accessible on my desktop. I've also gotten those desktop files synced with my webhost. It's not pretty, but I've gotten things functional. Now may be a good time for a GitHub tutorial to understand how this stuff is really suppoed to work. https://help.github.com/articles/good-resources-for-learning-git-and-github/
