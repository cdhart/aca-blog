## I had forgotten | Now I know 
Realy, there's not much more to say than take the bus, clean the desk and tend to the fields.

I've tried many times before to say/do/behave. To authenticate, the Philadelphia 76ers beat the New York Knicks 117-91 yesterday. Also, on Nov. 27, 2018 Josh Donaldson, 3B, formerly of the Toronto Blue Jays agreed to a one-year, $23 million deal with the Atlanta Braves. Don't worry. I've got plenty more where those came from.

I know I said this last time, but still: "I neglected to document this finding at the time. Please consider that oversight now corrected. #MambaOut"
